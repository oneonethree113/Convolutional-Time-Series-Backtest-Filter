# Convolutional-Time-Serise-Backtest-Filter
Try to use a neural network as a signal filter

In techical anaylsis area, price action is one of the most famous and popular method. 
Price action is a method that consider the pattern of price changes to prodict the future price. 3 pushes, deseasing triangle, S/R filp etc. are examples of pattern in price action.
The goal of this project is trying to let the network be a signal filter with price action. 
For example, if the strategy sends a buying signal, but the network detects some selling pattern, the network will filter the signal.
